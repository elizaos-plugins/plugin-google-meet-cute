import { AgentRuntime } from "@elizaos/core";
import { googleMeetPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-google-meet-cute";

// Example character configuration
const character = {
  name: "MeetBot",
  bio: "A helpful bot that joins Google Meet meetings",
  plugins: ["@elizaos/plugin-google-meet-cute"],
};

// Example usage in your agent
async function setupAgent() {
  // Initialize your agent runtime
  const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
    character,
    // ... other configuration
  });

  // The plugin will be automatically loaded and available
  
  // Example: Join a meeting programmatically
  // This would typically be triggered by a user message
  const meetingUrl = "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij";
  
  // The plugin provides actions that can be triggered:
  // - JOIN_GOOGLE_MEET: Join a meeting
  // - LEAVE_GOOGLE_MEET: Leave the current meeting
  // - GENERATE_MEETING_REPORT: Create a summary (when transcription is implemented)
}

// Environment variables needed:
// GOOGLE_MEET_EMAIL=your-bot@gmail.com
// GOOGLE_MEET_PASSWORD=your-password (optional)
// PLAYWRIGHT_USER_DATA_DIR=./browser-data (optional, for persistent sessions)

// Example prompts that trigger the plugin:
// - "Join this meeting: https://meet.google.com/xyz-123-456"
// - "Please attend our team standup at https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij"
// - "Leave the current meeting"

Google Meet Plugin - Playwright Migration Example

This plugin now uses Playwright for browser automation, providing:
- Better reliability and stability
- Cross-browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Improved debugging capabilities
- Better TypeScript integration

Note: Audio capture and transcription features are temporarily unavailable
and will be reimplemented in a future update.
